# Introduction #

For CS 247 Winter 2011, we're building an android app that will help students log their daily study sessions by checking into study spots on campus, locate other people who are working on the same classes in real time, and get access to campus wide study data...
  * A student can check-in to a study location to log his study sessions.
  * A student can locate all other people who are studying the class of his interest, in real time
  * A student can search for study spots and see number of classmates studying at a study spot, how quite a study spot is etc.., and choose the one he likes the most.
  * Since students log their study sessions over the course of the quarter (by checking-in and checking-out) we aggregate all the data and create a campus wide statistics of number of study hours per week for each class.
  * A student can see his weekly study log (number of hours he is studying for each class) and compare it with campus wide study data for that class.
  * A student can select set of classes and see if they balance out properly in a quarter.
