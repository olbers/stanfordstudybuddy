<h1>About Study Buddy</h1>
<hr />
<p>
For CS247 Winter 2011, we developed an android app that will help students study smartly and efficiently.
</p>
	<ul>
    <li>
    Students can check-in and check-out of a study location which will help their classmates know who is studying where and when.
    </li>
    <li>
    That will help student know where his classmates are studying and he can collaborate with them for a group study, a study session etc. in a real time.
    </li>
    <li>
    It will help student find a study place based on where his other class mates are studying.
    </li>
    <li>
    Since users log their study sessions over the course of the quarter (by checking-in and checking-out), we aggregate all the data and show lots of useful statistics like week by week course-load for a subject which can help future students plan things better.
    </li>
    <li>
    A comparison graph of previous statistics vs. the current time a student is putting for a subject would really help him get the feedback about whether he is putting up enough time for the subject or not. 
	</li>
    </ul>
