= Application Platform =

The application would be implemented for Android phones. It would be tested on Android phones only. However, in future we may plan to launch a web version and iPhone version.

= High Level Architecture =

  # /depot - is the root of the source code repository
  # /depot/server - root of all server side code
  # /depot/server/modules - different server side modules (eg.. check-in, check-out, login, registration etc...)
  # depot/server/common - code that is shared across different modules (eg.. database connection code)
  # /depot/client/android - root for the android client
  # /depot/client/web - root for the web client (we are not doing it)

All server modules are written in PHP. The back end database is in MySql.

All client side code is written in Java.

The HTTP is our primary communication channel. The client side makes HTTP requests to server modules. We use JASON as the data format for reading the server response.
