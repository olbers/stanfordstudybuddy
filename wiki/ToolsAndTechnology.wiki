The application would be implemented for Android phones. It would be tested on Android phones only. However, we expected it to work on iPhone as well.

  * 1. PHP (all server side business logic would be written in PHP)
  * 2. Javascript (For dynamic interaction on the client side, we would use JavaScript. 
  * 3. Database (MySql will be used for storing all kinds of data)

  * 1. jQuery (for some UI effects, we will use jQuery library)
  * 2. ezSql (for ORM layer on the MySQl database)

We will add more tools as we move along.
