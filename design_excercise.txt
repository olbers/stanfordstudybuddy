User's motivation:

1: people already motivated: many people have their defined study time tables and they regulary check if they
   are on track with it or are behind the track etc... (they reserve library study rooms in advance)
   
   1. study reminder when you are not on track
   2. we can further motivate them with stanadard data (accumulated over the period of time)

   3. creating study groups

2: for people with low motivation: 
   1. invitation (reciprocity)
   2. can get help in real time
   3. social proof
   4. suggestion (CS109 problem set#3 due on Feb 8. There are two groups who have planned study session at Meyer tomorrow.)

Path:
